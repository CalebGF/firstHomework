Welcome to Iguana-Coding RGP Battle Simulator

First at all, please read carefully the instructions:

- The characters are grouped in parties and the battle will be between 2 parties. So before the battle could start you need to add warriors or wizards in both parties (the parties could have any size and could be mixed with warriors and wizards).

- The battles will be 1 vs 1. So you will need to be able to choose between members of the party to duel another member from the rival party.

- The battle will be by rounds, in each round both combatants will attack at the same time (so you even if one combatant do the killing blow both will take damage). So the combat could end in a tie.

- When the battle is over the winner will return to the party and the loser will be removed and sent to the graveyard. Then you can choose the combatants for the next duel.

- When a party lose all their members a winner party is declared.
