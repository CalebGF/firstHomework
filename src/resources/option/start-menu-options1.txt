Let's create all characters for each team(Party) manually...

Let's create two parties with 3 different characters in each party:

First, you can choose whether you want to create a wizard or a warrior.

➷ Type "1" to create a Wizard
➷ Type "2" to create a Warrior

Next, you can choose a name for it.

➷ Type the desired name. For example, "Valentina".

Then, you can customise the properties of the character, within pre-set parameters.
These are the limits of your customisation:

☆ Wizard Case ☆
================

- Health Points: 50-100
- Mana: 10-50
- Intelligence: 1-50

× Warrior Case ×
================

- Health Points: 100-200
- Stamina: 10-50
- Strength: 1-10

Once you have selected the 6 characters, you will have created the two personalised parties!

Let's fun! ٩(-̮̮̃-̃)۶
